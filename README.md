# Project 4 - *Twitter Redux*

**Twitter Redux** is an android app that allows a user to view home and mentions timelines, view user profiles with user timelines, as well as compose and post a new tweet. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] The app includes **all required user stories** from Week 3 Twitter Client
* [ ] User can **switch between Timeline and Mention views using tabs**
  * [ ] User can view their home timeline tweets.
  * [ ] User can view the recent mentions of their username.
* [ ] User can navigate to **view their own profile**
  * [ ] User can see picture, tagline, # of followers, # of following, and tweets on their profile.
* [ ] User can **click on the profile image** in any tweet to see **another user's** profile.
 * [ ] User can see picture, tagline, # of followers, # of following, and tweets of clicked user.
 * [ ] Profile view includes that user's timeline
* [ ] User can [infinitely paginate](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Endless-Scrolling-with-AdapterViews-and-RecyclerView) any of these timelines (home, mentions, user) by scrolling to the bottom

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] User can view following / followers list through the profile
* [ ] Implements robust error handling, [check if internet is available](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Sending-and-Managing-Network-Requests#checking-for-network-connectivity), handle error cases, network failures
* [ ] When a network request is sent, user sees an [indeterminate progress indicator](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Handling-ProgressBars#progress-within-actionbar)
* [ ] User can **"reply" to any tweet on their home timeline**
  * [ ] The user that wrote the original tweet is automatically "@" replied in compose
* [ ] User can click on a tweet to be **taken to a "detail view"** of that tweet
 * [ ] User can take favorite (and unfavorite) or retweet actions on a tweet
* [ ] User can **search for tweets matching a particular query** and see results
* [ ] Usernames and hashtags are styled and clickable within tweets [using clickable spans](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Working-with-the-TextView#creating-clickable-styled-spans)

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

* [ ] Use Parcelable instead of Serializable using the popular [Parceler library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Parceler).
* [ ] Leverages the [data binding support module](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Applying-Data-Binding-for-Views) to bind data into layout templates.
* [ ] On the profile screen, leverage the [CoordinatorLayout](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Handling-Scrolls-with-CoordinatorLayout#responding-to-scroll-events) to [apply scrolling behavior](https://hackmd.io/s/SJyDOCgU) as the user scrolls through the profile timeline.
* [ ] User can view their direct messages (or send new ones)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
